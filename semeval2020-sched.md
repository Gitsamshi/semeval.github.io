### Session Two: \*SEM/SemEval keynote talk: [Afra Alishahi](http://afra.alishahi.name/)

16:00-17:00 <details open><summary>_Grounded language learning, from sounds and images to meaning_, Afra Alishahi, University of Tilburg</summary>
 
Abstract: Humans learn to understand speech from weak and noisy supervision: they manage to extract structure and meaning from speech by simply being exposed to utterances situated and grounded in their daily sensory experience. Emulating this remarkable skill has been the goal of numerous studies; however researchers have often used severely simplified settings where either the language input or the extralinguistic sensory input, or both, are small-scale and symbolically represented. I present a series of studies on modelling visually grounded language understanding. Using variations of recurrent neural networks to model the temporal nature of spoken language, we examine how form and meaning-based linguistic knowledge emerges from the input signal.

## What is SemEval?

__SemEval__ is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. 
Each year's workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared.

SemEval is sponsored by the [SIGLEX](http://alt.qcri.org/siglex/) Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

It will take place September 13â€“14, 2020 in Barcelona, Spain, colocated with [COLING 2020](https://coling2020.org/).

## Anti-Harassment policy

SemEval highly values the open exchange of ideas, freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate. We support and uphold the [NAACL Anti-Harassment policy](http://naacl.org/policies/anti-harassment.html). Participants are encouraged to send any concerns or questions to the [NAACL Board members](http://naacl.org/officers/), [Priscilla Rasmussen](mailto:acl@aclweb.org) and/or the workshop organizers.

#### Session Two: \*SEM/SemEval keynote talk: [Afra Alishahi](http://afra.alishahi.name/)

16:00-17:00 <details open><summary>_Grounded language learning, from sounds and images to meaning_, Afra Alishahi, University of Tilburg</summary>
 
Abstract: Humans learn to understand speech from weak and noisy supervision: they manage to extract structure and meaning from speech by simply being exposed to utterances situated and grounded in their daily sensory experience. Emulating this remarkable skill has been the goal of numerous studies; however researchers have often used severely simplified settings where either the language input or the extralinguistic sensory input, or both, are small-scale and symbolically represented. I present a series of studies on modelling visually grounded language understanding. Using variations of recurrent neural networks to model the temporal nature of spoken language, we examine how form and meaning-based linguistic knowledge emerges from the input signal.

#### Session Five: SemEval keynote talk: [Jackie C.K. Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/)

16:00-17:00 <details open><summary>_From Discourse Structure to Semantics in Automatic Summarization_, Jackie C.K. Cheung, McGill University</summary>

Abstract: The stereotypical discourse structure of a genre is often a good indicator of importance for content selection in automatic summarization. For example, the opening sentences of a news article usually form a good summary of it. However, relying on discourse structure could arguably be seen as a crutch on our way towards modelling the semantic content of source documents and the summaries. In this talk, I discuss the possibilities enabled by more explicitly thinking about semantics for neural abstractive summarization, with a focus on datasets and evaluations. I will discuss recent work on detecting and correcting factual inconsistencies in abstractive summaries. I will also emphasize the need for new summarization tasks that target semantic generalization and aggregation.

## What is SemEval?

__SemEval__ is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. 
Each year's workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared.

SemEval is sponsored by the [SIGLEX](http://alt.qcri.org/siglex/) Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

## [SemEval-2020](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2020/)

The 14th edition of SemEval features 12 tasks on topics ranging from lexical semantic change to offensive language in social media.

It will take place September 13â€“14, 2020 in Barcelona, Spain, colocated with [COLING 2020](https://coling2020.org/).
